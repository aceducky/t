# Project: Frontend Demo Implementation

You can check the required sample output screens from the `documentation pdf` located after the title "9. OUTPUT SCREENS". You have the creative freedom to make changes to the UI as needed. Please code the entire frontend based on the following specifications.

---
### Project Context:
- **Purpose:** Frontend demo for a final year project.
- **Longevity:** Code will not be maintained after the demo; focus on immediate visual impact and functionality.
- **Backend:** FastAPI.
- **Pages (5):**
	- **Home** (Static)
	- **Predict** (Dynamic: contains form with validation, loading indicators, and API result/error handling)
	- **About** (Static)
	- **How it works** (Static)
	- **Contact** (Static)
- **Authentication:** None required.

---
### Implementation Plan as of now:
Focus on a high-quality UI, robust form validation, and clear presentation of API results.
- **Schemas:** Reference Pydantic schemas in `app.py` to align frontend data structures.
- **Runtime and package manager:** bun
- **Stack:** We are using tanstack start.
- Always refer to latest docs before making any decision.

### Design Suggestions:
The following are suggested guidelines to help create a memorable and professional aesthetic. They are not strictly mandated but can serve as a creative starting point:

- **Concept:** Aim for a clear direction—whether refined minimalism or bold maximalism.
- **Typography:** Consider using distinctive, characterful fonts for headings paired with a clean body font, avoiding standard system defaults.
- **Color & Theme:** Use a cohesive palette defined via CSS variables. High-contrast accents often work better than muted, even distributions. We should be able to change all values at one place and it should be easy to change.
- **Motion:** Small micro-interactions
- **Spatial Composition:** Don't be afraid of asymmetry, overlapping elements, or generous negative space to break away from "cookie-cutter" layouts.
- **Visual Depth:** Consider using gradient meshes, subtle noise textures, or layered transparencies instead of flat solid backgrounds to add atmosphere.

*Note: These design principles are intended to inspire creative choices. Feel free to interpret them as you see fit for the context of the project.*
